- 🌱 I’m currently learning / working on multiple projects, I keep getting sidetracked by new
        issues / problems. Currently I'm rebuilding / setting up / configuring my main workstation (my laptop) with Windows 10, WSL2 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, GitHub, Visual Studio Code and adding all the bells and whistles so that i can complete the rebuild, get back to my SnapMaker 2 3D Printer/CnC/Laser Engraver so i cna start printing cases/items for my Ardiuno maker projects and setup some network monitoring along the way as I migrate my Music/Videos/Books off my 2013 iMac thats reached it end of life.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
        this is a tuff one, I'm a retired Workstation\Server\Backup Engineer, with a good deal of knowledge in computer hardware & programming, basic knowledge of networking, rudimentary knowledge of 3D Printing/CnC/Laser Engraving along with Microcontrollers. So due to medical reasons (partial reason for my early retirement) i'm limited to remote work / knowledge dumps.
